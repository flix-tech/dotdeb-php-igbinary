Description: igbinary serializer for PHP
 Igbinary is a drop in replacement for the standard php serializer. Instead of
 time and space consuming textual representation, igbinary stores php data
 structures in a compact binary form. Savings are significant when using
 memcached or similar memory based storages for serialized data.
